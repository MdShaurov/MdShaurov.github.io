    <h1>How to play:</h1>
    <p>Shuffle the board first by clicking the "shuffle" button. You can swap the position of a number with the empty spot on the board <br/>
      by clicking on a number neighbouring the empty spot. You can not swap diagonally and you have a time limit of 30 minutes. <br/> 
      The aim of this game is to arrange the numbers so that the board looks exactly the same as below. The stopwatch will automatically stop once <br/> 
      you have arranged the numbers correctly.</p>
